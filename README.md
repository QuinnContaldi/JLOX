## ðŸŒŸ Why This Book Matters to Me
*Crafting Interpreters* by Robert Nystrom has had a profound impact on my growth as a programmer. I was fortunate that my mentor recommended it to me â€” an act that truly changed my direction in life and deepened my appreciation for programming languages.
> At first, I was too overwhelmed with classes and projects to give the book the attention it deserved. But after completing my senior projects, I finally had a free summer, and I knew it was the perfect time to dive in.
> I was preparing to continue my work as a research assistant in academic programming languages and take a graduate-level compilers course in the fall. What better way to prepare than by learning from one of the most beloved books on the subject?
> I wonâ€™t lie I was nervous. Compilers have a reputation, especially among undergrads. At my university, the compilers course hadnâ€™t been offered in six years until my mentor decided to revive it.
> Instead, most students (including myself) took **Automata and Formal Languages**, a class infamous for its difficulty. It was tough: 60% of the grade came from 10 in-person quizzes, and the remaining 40% was the final exam. Many of us were just hoping for a passing grade.
> But my friends and I welcomed the challenge we had already taken **Game Engine Architecture**, another one of the toughest classes offered. It was in that class that I met my mentor. So, we dove in headfirst, and to our surprise, we walked away with Aâ€™s and Bâ€™s.
> It was during *Automata* that I began to develop a deep respect for programming language theory. It was like finishing a marathon brutal, but incredibly rewarding. And I knew I wanted to keep running.
> Reading *Crafting Interpreters* felt like the next natural step. The book helped me understand not just the technical side of interpreters, but the elegance of language design.
> This repository documents my learning. Itâ€™s filled with notes, explanations, and code as I explore and implement my own interpreter based on Robert Nystrom's JLOX. It's also a way to share what Iâ€™ve learned with others who might be on a similar journey.
> However, this is more than just a study guide itâ€™s a showcase of my dedication, curiosity, and commitment to growth as a programmer. If you're a recruiter visiting from my resume, I hope these notes give you a glimpse into the wonderful world of programming languages.
> I also hope this repository is like a glass of fresh water after all the calculator apps and ChatGPT wrapper projects you may have seen. Not that those projects are wrong we all start somewhere, but a little language from a great book is exciting.
> I really hope this repository inspires you to look deeper into the languages we use every day. Regardless, Iâ€™m proud of what Iâ€™ve built here. Itâ€™s been the highlight of my summer and one of the most rewarding programming experiences Iâ€™ve had so far.

## ðŸ’Œ A Message to the Author
> To Robert Nystrom â€” thank you. Your work has inspired me deeply. I was so grateful for the free web version of the book that I bought a physical copy to support you. Youâ€™ve created something truly special, and I hope more developers find it and are inspired as I have been.
> If anyone reading this has enjoyed these notes or learned from them, I strongly encourage you to visit the authorâ€™s website:

    * A modern compiler construction textbook used in my graduate compilers course. It goes deeper into code generation, optimization, and runtime systems, helping bridge the gap between interpreters (as covered in *Crafting Interpreters*) and full compiler pipelines.
    * Topics include semantic elaboration, control flow translation, code shape, and register allocation â€” essential for understanding how high-level syntax becomes executable machine code.

    * A foundational theory textbook that expands on the automata, grammars, and parsing theory briefly touched upon in *Crafting Interpreters*.
    * It covers topics like DFA/NFA, regular languages, context-free grammars, and parsing â€” especially useful for understanding the formal structures behind lexical analysis and syntax trees.

3. \:orange\_book: [Programming Language Pragmatics, 5th Edition](https://mlscott14627.github.io/PLP5e_online/)
    * A comprehensive book on programming language design and implementation. It explores how different language features are expressed and executed, reinforcing the connection between theory and practice.
    * Useful for understanding semantics, type systems, concurrency, runtime memory models, and design tradeoffs. Shows how other real-world languages handle similar constructs.

# JLOX - Lox Interpreter in Java

An implementation of the Lox programming language from the book *Crafting Interpreters* by Bob Nystrom. This project includes:
- A full Lox interpreter (`Lox.java`) Currently on chapter 9 
- An AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) printer (`AstTreePrinter.java`) for visualizing syntax trees

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 17+**
- **Git** (for cloning the repository)

---

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/QuinnContaldi/JLOX.git
cd JLOX
```
#### 2. Compile the Source Code

From the root directory, compile the source files:
```
javac src/com/craftinginterpreters/lox/*.java
```
#### 3. Running the Interpreter

Run the interpreter with a sample Lox file:
```bash
java -cp src com.craftinginterpreters.lox.Lox src/com/craftinginterpreters/lox/LoxProgram.txt
```
This will execute the contents of LoxProgram.txt, which contains a basic Lox script.
ðŸ‘‰ View LoxProgram.txt

#### 4. Viewing the AST

You can also visualize the syntax tree of a sample Lox expression:

java -cp src com.craftinginterpreters.lox.AstTreePrinter

No input file is required; simply type your JLox code directly in AstTreePrinter.java.
